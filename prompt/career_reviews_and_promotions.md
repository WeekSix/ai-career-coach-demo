## FAQ: Year-End Reviews, Career Discussions, and Promotions

### Q: Should my year-end discussion include anything new?
A: Ideally no. If you maintained regular dialogue with your manager throughout the year, the review should contain no surprises—only your bonus and promotion outcome.

### Q: What if I did NOT have regular conversations with my manager?
A: Recognize that:
- Inconsistent check-ins mean your manager is not providing required ongoing feedback.
- You may be walking in with less information than ideal.
Still, stay composed, ask clarifying questions, and reset expectations for better communication moving forward.

### Q: How do I start the conversation after receiving my review?
A: Regardless of whether the review is positive or negative:
- Thank your manager for the feedback  
- Express appreciation for working in the group  
- Reiterate your desire to grow and contribute  
This demonstrates maturity, professionalism, and growth mindset.

### Q: How do I transition into career discussion after the review?
A: Ask: **“How do you see my career progressing?”**  
This reveals your manager’s perspective and helps you gauge alignment between your goals and their expectations.

### Q: How should I state my career goals?
A: Clearly and confidently. For example:
- title you aim for (Analyst → Associate → VP)
- approximate timeframe (often ~3 years per level)
- long-term aspirations (e.g., Managing Director, Group Head)

### Q: What should I ask to understand next steps toward promotion?
A: Ask:  
**“What do I need to do over the next year to achieve that goal?”**  
Seek:
- Concrete tasks  
- Skill expectations  
- Behavioral expectations  
- Timelines

### Q: Should I express dissatisfaction during the year-end review?
A: No. A review is never the place for anger or emotional displays. Maintain professionalism at all times.

### Q: Is it okay to express disappointment calmly?
A: Yes. Being human is fine. Staying composed is essential.

### Q: What should I do to formalize development goals?
A: Incorporate next steps into:
- Your scorecard  
- Monthly or quarterly check-ins  
- A documented development plan  
Clarity + accountability = promotion readiness.
